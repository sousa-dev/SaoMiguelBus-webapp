# Bus Tracking Feature Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement a bus tracking feature for premium users that allows them to track buses based on scheduled timetables and estimated arrival times. The feature will work for both search results and step-by-step directions, store data locally until route completion, and provide clear warnings that this is not live tracking.

## Key Features

### 1. Core Tracking Functionality
- **Departure Countdown Display**: Show time remaining until next departure throughout the day (e.g., "8 hours left for departure")
- **Day Selection**: Users choose which days of the week to show tracking (weekdays, weekends, or every day)
- **No Time Selection Required**: Tracking is always active during the day, showing countdown to next scheduled departure
- **Premium Integration**: Only available to premium users (behind ad removal paywall)
- **Local Storage**: Store tracking data locally until route completion
- **Search Day Association**: Associate times with the search day for accurate scheduling

### 2. "Track Every Day" Feature
- **Pinned Routes**: Allow users to pin common routes for daily tracking
- **Homepage Widget**: Quick access to active tracking behind premium paywall
- **Auto-Display**: Show pinned routes on homepage with departure countdown
- **Day Configuration**: Configure which days of the week to show each route
- **Smart Management**: Easy management of pinned routes

### 3. User Interface Components
- **Tracking Buttons**: "Track Bus" and "Track Every Day" buttons on route cards
- **Disclaimer Modal**: Clear warnings about estimated times vs live tracking
- **Pin Route Modal**: Configure days for pinned routes
- **Homepage Widget**: Display active tracking and pinned routes
- **Management Interface**: Manage pinned routes and active tracking

### 4. Notifications (Optional Enhancement)
- **Departure Alerts**: Notify users when departure time approaches
- **Route Updates**: Notify about schedule changes or delays
- **Permission Handling**: Request notification permissions appropriately

## Data Structures

### Tracking Data
```javascript
{
  activeTracking: [
    {
      id: "unique_id",
      routeId: "route_id",
      routeNumber: "route_number",
      origin: "origin_stop",
      destination: "destination_stop",
      allStops: {stop: "time"},
      searchDay: "weekday|weekend|both",
      startTime: "timestamp",
      estimatedArrival: "timestamp",
      status: "active|completed|cancelled"
    }
  ],
  pinnedRoutes: [
    {
      id: "unique_id",
      routeId: "route_id",
      routeNumber: "route_number",
      origin: "origin_stop",
      destination: "destination_stop",
      allStops: {stop: "time"},
      pinnedDays: ["weekday", "weekend", "both"],
      autoTrackTime: "08:00", // Default time for reference
      createdAt: "timestamp"
    }
  ],
  settings: {
    disclaimerAccepted: boolean,
    notificationsEnabled: boolean,
    maxPinnedRoutes: 5
  }
}
```
