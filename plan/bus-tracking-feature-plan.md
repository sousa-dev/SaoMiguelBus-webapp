# Bus Tracking Feature Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement a bus tracking feature for premium users that allows them to track buses based on scheduled timetables and estimated arrival times. The feature will work for both search results and step-by-step directions, store data locally until route completion, and provide clear warnings that this is not live tracking.

## Key Features

## Data Structures ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

### Tracking Data
```javascript
{
  activeTracking: [
    {
      id: "unique_id",
      routeId: "route_id",
      routeNumber: "route_number",
      origin: "origin_stop",
      destination: "destination_stop",
      allStops: {stop: "time"},
      searchDay: "weekday|weekend|both",
      availableDays: "weekday|weekend|both", // Auto-detected route availability
      searchDate: "YYYY-MM-DD",
      nextDeparture: "HHhMM",
      estimatedArrival: "HHhMM",
      status: "active|completed|cancelled",
      createdAt: "timestamp",
      expiresAt: "timestamp",
      type: "route",
      userStops: {origin: "time", destination: "time"}, // Extracted user-specific stops
      isPinned: false
    }
  ],
  pinnedRoutes: [
    {
      id: "unique_id",
      routeId: "route_id",
      routeNumber: "route_number",
      origin: "origin_stop",
      destination: "destination_stop",
      allStops: {stop: "time"},
      availableDays: "weekday|weekend|both", // Auto-detected
      pinnedDays: ["weekday", "weekend", "both"],
      autoTrackTime: "08:00",
      createdAt: "timestamp",
      expiresAt: "timestamp", // Extended to 30 days
      status: "pinned",
      isPinned: true
    }
  ],
  trackingHistory: [], // For future analytics
      preferences: {
      defaultTrackingDuration: 240, // 4 hours in minutes
      maxConcurrentTracks: 5,
      maxPinnedRoutes: 3,
      autoTrackingEnabled: boolean
    },
  lastCleanup: "timestamp",
  lastCacheRenewal: "timestamp" // Cache renewal system for data persistence
}
```

## Step-by-Step Directions Tracking Requirements

### Missing Implementation Details
The current implementation only supports tracking from **search results** but is missing tracking functionality for **step-by-step directions**. This needs to be implemented with different behavior:

#### Journey-Specific Tracking (Step-by-Step Directions)
- **Single Journey Focus**: Track this specific route for this specific day/time only
- **No Daily Pinning**: Should NOT offer "Track Every Day" option since it's for a specific journey
- **Specific Time Window**: Track only the departure/arrival times shown in the directions
- **Limited Scope**: Track until the journey is completed or expires (4 hours max)
- **Different UI**: Only show "Track This Journey" button (no pin button)

#### Differences from General Route Tracking
| Feature | Search Results | Step-by-Step Directions |
|---------|---------------|------------------------|
| Track Button | ✅ "Track Bus" | ❌ "Track This Journey" |
| Pin Button | ✅ "Track Every Day" | ❌ Not applicable |
| Scope | Multiple days/times | Single journey only |
| Duration | 4 hours or daily | Until journey completion |
| Pinning | Can be pinned | Cannot be pinned |

#### Implementation Needed
- Add tracking button to `createRouteCard()` in `directionsApiHandler.js`
- Create journey-specific tracking data structure
- Modify tracking UI to show "Track This Journey" instead of "Track Bus"
- Ensure no pinning option is available for step-by-step routes
- Add specific analytics tracking for directions-based tracking
